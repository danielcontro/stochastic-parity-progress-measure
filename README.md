# stochastic-parity-progress-measure
Repository containing code for the synthesis of stochastic parity progress measures

# Installation/Usage

- Clone the repository
- Install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (**recommended to use a virtual environment**)
- Define the system as a `ReactiveModule` object
- Define the desired property by specifying the indicator function of the
  various priority levels over the states of the system
- Compute the Stochastic Parity Progress Measure
